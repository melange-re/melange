val mapper : Ast_mapper.mapper

(* object
    for setter : we can push more into [Lsend] and enclose it with a unit type

    for getter :

    (* Invariant: we expect the typechecker & lambda emitter
       will not do agressive inlining
       Worst things could happen
    {[
      let x = y## case 3  in
      x 2
    ]}
       in normal case, it should be compiled into Lambda
    {[
      let x = Lsend(y,case, [3]) in
      Lapp(x,2)
    ]}

       worst:
    {[ Lsend(y, case, [3,2])
    ]}
       for setter(include case setter), this could
       be prevented by type system, for getter.

       solution: we can prevent this by rewrite into
    {[
      Fn.run1  (!x# case) v
      ]}
       *)
