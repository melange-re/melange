(**
  [hit_any_variables fv l]
  check the lambda expression [l] if has some free
  variables captured by [fv].
  Note it does not do any checking like below
  [Llet(str,id,arg,body)]
  it only check [arg] or [body] is hit or not, there
  is a case that [id] is hit in [arg] but also exists
  in [fv], this is ignored.
