        [hit_any_variables fv l]
        check the lambda expression [l] if has some free
        variables captured by [fv].
        Note it does not do any checking like below
        [Llet(str,id,arg,body)]
        it only check [arg] or [body] is hit or not, there
        is a case that [id] is hit in [arg] but also exists
        in [fv], this is ignored.
