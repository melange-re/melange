     A naive beta reduce would break the invariants of the optmization.


     The sane but slowest  way:
       when we do a beta reduction, we need rename all variables inlcuding
       let-bound ones

     A conservative one:
       - for internal one
         rename params and let bound variables
       - for external one (seriaized)
         if it's enclosed environment should be good enough
         so far, we only inline enclosed lambdas
     TODO: rename

    Optimizations:
    {[
      (fun x y -> ...     ) 100 3
    ]}
    we can bound [x] to [100] in a single step
