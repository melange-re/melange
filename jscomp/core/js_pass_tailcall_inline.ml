(* When we inline a function call, if we don't do a beta-reduction immediately, there is
   a chance that it is ignored, (we can not assume that each pass is robust enough)

   After we do inlining, it makes sense to do another constant folding and propogation

    if the order is not correct, or even worse, only the wrong one [find_beg] in [find_end] get expanded
    (when we forget to recursive apply), then some code non-dead [find_beg] will be marked as dead,
