(**
  [convert exports lam]
  it also collect [exit_map] and a collection of potential depended modules [may_depends]
  In this pass we also synchronized aliases so that
    {[
      let a1 = a0 in
      let a2 = a1 in
      let a3 = a2 in
      let a4 = a3 in
    ]}
    converted to
    {[
      let a1 = a0 in
      let a2 = a0 in
      let a3 = a0 in
      let a4 = a0 in
    ]}
    we dont eliminate unused let bindings to leave it for {!Lam_pass_lets_dce}
    we should remove all those let aliases, otherwise, it will be
    pushed into alias table again
