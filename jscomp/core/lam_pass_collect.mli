(** This pass is used to collect meta data information.

    It includes:
    alias table, arity for identifiers and might more information,

    ATTENTION:
    For later pass to keep its information complete and up to date,
    we  need update its table accordingly

    - Alias inference is not for substitution, it is for analyze which module is
      actually a global module or an exception, so it can be relaxed a bit
      (without relying on strict analysis)

    - Js object (local) analysis

    Design choice:

    Side effectful operations:
       - Lassign
       - Psetfield

    1. What information should be collected:

    2. What's the key
       If it's identifier,

    Information that is always sound, not subject to change

    - shall we collect that if an identifier is passed as a parameter, (useful for escape analysis),
    however, since it's going to change after inlning (for local function)

    - function arity, subject to change when you make it a mutable ref and change it later

    - Immutable blocks of identifiers

      if identifier itself is function/non block then the access can be inlined
      if identifier itself is immutable block can be inlined
      if identifier is mutable block can be inlined (without Lassign) since

    - When collect some information, shall we propogate this information to
      all alias table immeidately

      - annotation identifiers (at first time)
      -
