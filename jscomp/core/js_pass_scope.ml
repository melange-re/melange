    Three kind of variables  (defined in the loop scope)
    1. loop mutable variables
       As long as variables change per iteration, defined in a loop (in the same loop)
        and captured by a closure
       the loop, iff  be lexically scoped
       Tailcall parameters are considered defined inside the loop
    - unless it's defined
       outside all the loops - note that for nested loops, if it's defined
       in the outerloop and captured by the inner loop,
       it still has to be lexically scoped.

       How do we detect whether it is loop invariant or not
       - depend on loop variant
       - depend on mutuable valuse
       - non pure (function call)

       so we need collect mutable variables
       1. from lambda + loop (for/i) + tailcall params
       2. defined in the loop and can not determine it is invariant
          in such cases we can determine it's immutable
          1. const
          2. only depend on immutable values and no function call?

    ## The following would take advantage of nested loops
    2. loop invariant observable varaibles
        {[
         var x = (console.log(3), 32)
        ]}
    3. loop invariant non-observable variables

    Invariant:
    loop invariant (observable or not) variables can not depend on
    loop mutable values so that once we detect loop Invariant variables
    all its dependency are loop invariant as well, so we can do loop
    Invariant code motion.

    TODO:
    loop invariant can be layered, it will be loop invariant
    in the inner layer while loop variant in the outer layer.
