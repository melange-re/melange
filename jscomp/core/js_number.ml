   In ocaml, the interpretation of floating-point literals that
   fall outside the range of representable floating-point values is undefined.
   Also, (_) are accepted

   see https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/268 that ocaml will have HEXADECIMAL notation
   support in 4.3

   The Hex part is quite different
