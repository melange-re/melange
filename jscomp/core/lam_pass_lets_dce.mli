val simplify_lets : Lam.t -> Lam.t
(**
   This pass would do beta reduction, and dead code elimination (adapted from compiler's built-in [Simplif] module )

   1. beta reduction -> Llet (Strict )
  
   2. The global table [occ] associates to each let-bound identifier
   the number of its uses (as a reference):
     - 0 if never used
     - 1 if used exactly once in and *not under a lambda or within a loop
     - > 1 if used several times or under a lambda or within a loop.

   The local table [bv] associates to each locally-let-bound variable
   its reference count, as above.  [bv] is enriched at let bindings
   but emptied when crossing lambdas and loops. 

   For this pass, when it' used under a lambda or within a loop, we don't do anything,
   in theory, we can still do something if it's pure but we are conservative here.

   [bv] is used to help caculate [occ] it is not useful outside
