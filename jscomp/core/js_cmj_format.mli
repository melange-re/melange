(** In this module, 
    currently only arity information is  exported, 

    Short term: constant literals are also exported 

    Long term:
    Benefit? since Google Closure Compiler already did such huge amount of work
    TODO: simple expression, literal small function  can be stored, 
    but what would happen if small function captures other environment
    for example 

    {[
      let f  = fun x -> g x 
    ]}

    {[
      let f = g 
    ]}
