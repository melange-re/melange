  [add_js_module hint_name module_name]
  Given a js module name and hint name, assign an id to it
  we also bookkeep it as [External] dependency.

  Note the complexity lies in that we should consolidate all
  same external dependencies into a single dependency.

  The strategy is that we first create a [Lam_module_ident.t]
  and  query it if already exists in [cache_tbl], if it already
  exists, we discard the freshly made one, and use the cached one,
  otherwise, use the freshly made one instead

  Invariant:
    any [id] as long as put in the [cached_tbl] should be always valid,
*)

(* The other dependencies are captured by querying
   either when [access] or when expansion,
   however such dependency can be removed after inlining etc.

   When we register such compile time dependency we classified
   it as
   Visit (ml), Builtin(built in js), External()

   For external, we never remove, we only consider
   remove dependency for Runtime and Visit, so
   when compile OCaml to Javascript, we only need
   pay attention to for those modules are actually used or not
