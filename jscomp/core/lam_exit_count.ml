(**
  This function counts how each [exit] is used, it will affect how the following optimizations performed.

  Some smart cases (this requires the following optimizations follow it):

  {[
    Lstaticcatch(l1, (i,_), l2)
  ]}
  If [l1] does not contain [(exit i)],
  [l2] will be removed, so don't count it.

  About Switch default branch handling, it maybe backend-specific
  See https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/commit/fcf3571123e2c914768e34f1bd17e4cbaaa7d212#diff-704f66c0fa0fc9339230b39ce7d90919
  For Lstringswitch ^

  For Lswitch, if it is not exhuastive pattern match, default will be counted twice.
  Since for pattern match,  we will  test whether it is  an integer or block, both have default cases predicate: [sw_consts_full] vs nconsts
