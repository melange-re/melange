    try to remove the indirection of [v.(i)] by inlining when [v]
    is a known block,
    if not, it will call [cb ()].

    Note due to different control flow, a constant block
    may result in out-of bound access, in that case, we should
    just ignore it. This does not mean our
    optimization is wrong, it means we hit an unreachable branch.
    for example
    {{
      let myShape = A 10 in
      match myShape with
      | A x -> x  (* only access field [0]*)
      | B (x,y) -> x + y (* Here it will try to access field [1] *)
    }}
