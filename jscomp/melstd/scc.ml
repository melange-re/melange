type node = Vec_int.t

(**
   [int] as data for this algorithm
   Pros:
   1. Easy to eoncode algorithm (especially given that the capacity of node is known)
   2. Algorithms itself are much more efficient
   3. Node comparison semantics is clear
   4. Easy to print output
   Cons:
   1. post processing input data
