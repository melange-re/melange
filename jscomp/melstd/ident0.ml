(* XXX(anmonteiro): This is an artifact of the 4.12 upgrade that we need to fix
   at some point. This project (as well as the OCaml compiler, previously)
   abuses the `Ident.t` type in order to know whether some identifier comes
   from the JS side or not, with the objective of dealing with shadowing
   accordingly (semantics of OCaml and JS are different, e.g. with regards to
   recursion).

   An interesting read: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/1980 *)

(* `create_js` creates an ident that has been described to us by the JS FFI. In
   OCaml 4.06 and below, the `Ident.t` type abused `flags` and `stamp` to mark
   it as such ("global" values had a stamp of 0). After PR#1980 to OCaml, not
   only has the `Ident.t` type been made abstract, but also the `Global of
   string` constructor stopped taking "flags" (which we need to mark the value
   as coming from the JS FFI). *)
