(** A {b mutable} Hash set which allows customized hash behavior.

    All data are parameterized by not its only type but also a unique identity in
    the time of initialization, so that two {i HashSets of ints} initialized with different
    {i hash} functions will have different type.

    For example:
    {[
      type t = int
      module I0 =
        (val Belt.Id.hashableU
            ~hash:(fun[\@u] (a : t)  -> a & 0xff_ff)
            ~eq:(fun[\@u] a b -> a = b)
        )
      let s0 = make ~id:(module I0) ~hintSize:40
      module I1 =
        (val Belt.Id.hashableU
            ~hash:(fun[\@u] (a : t)  -> a & 0xff)
            ~eq:(fun[\@u] a b -> a = b)
        )
      let s1 = make ~id:(module I1) ~hintSize:40
    ]}

    The invariant must be held: for two elements who are {i equal},
    their hashed value should be the same

    Here the compiler would infer [s0] and [s1] having different type so that
    it would not mix.

    {[
      val s0 :  (int, I0.identity) t
      val s1 :  (int, I1.identity) t
    ]}

    We can add elements to the collection:

    {[

      let () =
        add s1 0;
        add s1 1
    ]}

    Since this is an mutable data strucure, [s1] will contain two pairs.

   module Poly = Belt_HashSetPoly

   - generic equal handles JS data structure
   - eq/hash consistent
