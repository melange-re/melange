(** [fromCharCode n]
  creates a string containing the character corresponding to that number; {i n} ranges from 0 to 65535. If out of range, the lower 16 bits of the value are used. Thus, [fromCharCode 0x1F63A] gives the same result as [fromCharCode 0xF63A].

@example {[
  fromCharCode 65 = "A";;
  fromCharCode 0x3c8 = {js|Ïˆ|js};;

  fromCharCode -64568 = {js|Ïˆ|js};;

@example {[

(** [fromCodePoint n]
  creates a string containing the character corresponding to that numeric code point. If the number is not a valid code point, {b raises} [RangeError]. Thus, [fromCodePoint 0x1F63A] will produce a correct value, unlike [fromCharCode 0x1F63A], and [fromCodePoint -5] will raise a [RangeError].

@example {[

(** [charAt n s] gets the character at index [n] within string [s]. If [n] is negative or greater than the length of [s], returns the empty string. If the string contains characters outside the range [\u0000-\uffff], it will return the first 16-bit value at that position in the string.

@example {[
  charAt 0, "Reason" = "R"
  charAt( 12, "Reason") = "";

The return type is [float] because this function returns [NaN] if [n] is less than zero or greater than the length of the string.

(** [codePointAt n s] returns the code point at position [n] within string [s] as a [Some] value. The return value handles code points greater than or equal to [0x10000]. If there is no code point at the given position, the function returns [None].

  [match regexp str] matches a string against the given [regexp]. If there is no match, it returns [None].

identical to [string] except with the first matching instance of [substr]
replaced by [newSubstr].

  [toLowerCase str] converts [str] to lower case using the locale-insensitive case mappings in the Unicode Character Database. Notice that the conversion can give different results depending upon context, for example with the Greek letter sigma, which has two different lower case forms when it is the last character in a string or not.

@example {[
  toLowerCase "ABC" = "abc";;
  toLowerCase {js|Î£Î |js} = {js|ÏƒÏ€|js};;
  toLowerCase {js|Î Î£|js} = {js|Ï€Ï‚|js};;
]}
*)
external toLowerCase : t = "toLowerCase" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(**
  [toLocaleLowerCase str] converts [str] to lower case using the current locale
*)
external toLocaleLowerCase : t = "toLocaleLowerCase" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(**
  [toUpperCase str] converts [str] to upper case using the locale-insensitive case mappings in the Unicode Character Database. Notice that the conversion can expand the number of letters in the result; for example the German [ÃŸ] capitalizes to two [S]es in a row.

@example {[
  toUpperCase "abc" = "ABC";;
  toUpperCase {js|StraÃŸe|js} = {js|STRASSE|js};;
  toLowerCase {js|Ï€Ï‚|js} = {js|Î Î£|js};;
]}
*)
external toUpperCase : t = "toUpperCase" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(**
  [toLocaleUpperCase str] converts [str] to upper case using the current locale
*)
external toLocaleUpperCase : t = "toLocaleUpperCase" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(**
  [trim str] returns a string that is [str] with whitespace stripped from both ends. Internal whitespace is not removed.

@example {[
  trim "   abc def   " = "abc def"
  trim "\n\r\t abc def \n\n\t\r " = "abc def"
]}
*)
external trim : t = "trim" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(* HTML wrappers *)

(**
  [anchor anchorName anchorText] creates a string with an HTML [<a>] element with [name] attribute of [anchorName] and [anchorText] as its content.

@example {[
  anchor "page1" "Page One" = "<a name=\"page1\">Page One</a>"
]}
*)
external anchor : t -> t = "anchor" [@@bs.send.pipe: t] (** ES2015 *)

(**
  [link urlText linkText] creates a string withan HTML [<a>] element with [href] attribute of [urlText] and [linkText] as its content.

@example {[
  link "page2.html" "Go to page two" = "<a href=\"page2.html\">Go to page two</a>"
]}
*)
external link : t -> t = "link" [@@bs.send.pipe: t] (** ES2015 *)

external castToArrayLike : t -> t Js_array2.array_like = "%identity"
(* FIXME: we should not encourage people to use [%identity], better
    to provide something using [@@bs.val] so that we can track such
    casting
