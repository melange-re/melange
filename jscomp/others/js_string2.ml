(** [fromCharCode n]
  creates a string containing the character corresponding to that number; {i n} ranges from 0 to 65535. If out of range, the lower 16 bits of the value are used. Thus, [fromCharCode 0x1F63A] gives the same result as [fromCharCode 0xF63A].

@example {[
  fromCharCode 65 = "A";;
  fromCharCode 0x3c8 = {js|Ïˆ|js};;
  fromCharCode 0xd55c = {js|í•œ|js};;
  fromCharCode -64568 = {js|Ïˆ|js};;

@example {[

(** [fromCodePoint n]
  creates a string containing the character corresponding to that numeric code point. If the number is not a valid code point, {b raises} [RangeError]. Thus, [fromCodePoint 0x1F63A] will produce a correct value, unlike [fromCharCode 0x1F63A], and [fromCodePoint -5] will raise a [RangeError].

@example {[

(** [get s n] returns as a string the character at the given index number. If [n] is out of range, this function returns [undefined], so at some point this function may be modified to return [t option].

(** [charAt n s] gets the character at index [n] within string [s]. If [n] is negative or greater than the length of [s], returns the empty string. If the string contains characters outside the range [\u0000-\uffff], it will return the first 16-bit value at that position in the string.

@example {[
  charAt "Reason" 0 = "R"
  charAt "Reason" 12 = "";
  charAt {js|Ráº½asÃ¶Å„|js} 5 = {js|Å„|js}
]}

(** [charCodeAt n s] returns the character code at position [n] in string [s]; the result is in the range 0-65535, unlke [codePointAt], so it will not work correctly for characters with code points greater than or equal to [0x10000].
The return type is [float] because this function returns [NaN] if [n] is less than zero or greater than the length of the string.

@example {[
  charCodeAt {js|ðŸ˜º|js} 0 returns 0xd83d
  codePointAt {js|ðŸ˜º|js} 0 returns Some 0x1f63a
]}

*)
external charCodeAt : t -> int -> float = "charCodeAt" [@@bs.send]

(** [codePointAt n s] returns the code point at position [n] within string [s] as a [Some] value. The return value handles code points greater than or equal to [0x10000]. If there is no code point at the given position, the function returns [None].

@example {[
  codePointAt {js|Â¿ðŸ˜º?|js} 1 = Some 0x1f63a

external endsWith : t -> t -> bool = "endsWith" [@@bs.send]

(** [endsWithFrom ending len str] returns [true] if the first [len] characters of [str] end with [ending], [false] otherwise. If [n] is greater than or equal to the length of [str], then it works like [endsWith]. (Honestly, this should have been named [endsWithAt], but oh well.)

@example {[
  endsWithFrom "abcd" "cd" 4 = true;;
  endsWithFrom "abcde" "cd" 3 = false;;
  endsWithFrom "abcde" "cde" 99 = true;;

(**

(**

The return value is relative to the beginning of the string, no matter where the search started from.

@example {[

  [match regexp str] matches a string against the given [regexp]. If there is no match, it returns [None].

identical to [string] except with the first matching instance of [substr]
replaced by [newSubstr].
