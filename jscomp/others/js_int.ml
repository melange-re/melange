(** Provides functions for inspecting and manipulating [int]s *)

 (** If we use number, we need coerce to int32 by adding `|0`,
    otherwise `+0` can be wrong.
    Most JS API is float oriented, it may overflow int32 or
    comes with [NAN]

(** Formats an [int] using exponential (scientific) notation

{b digits} specifies how many digits should appear after the decimal point. The
value must be in the range \[0, 20\] (inclusive).

{b Returns} a [string] representing the given value in exponential notation

The output will be rounded or padded with zeroes if necessary.

@raise RangeError if digits is not in the range \[0, 20\] (inclusive)

[toPrecision] differs from [toFixed] in that the former will format the number
with full precision, while the latter will not output any digits after the
decimal point.

@raise RangeError if digits is not in the range accepted by this function (what do you mean "vague"?)

@example {[

(** Formats an [int] using some fairly arbitrary rules

{b digits} specifies how many digits should appear in total. The
value must between 0 and some arbitrary number that's hopefully at least larger
than 20 (for Node it's 21. Why? Who knows).

{b Returns} a [string] representing the given value in fixed-point or scientific notation

The output will be rounded or padded with zeroes if necessary.

[toPrecisionWithPrecision] differs from [toFixedWithPrecision] in that the former
will count all digits against the precision, while the latter will count only
the digits after the decimal point. [toPrecisionWithPrecision] will also use
scientific notation if the specified precision is less than the number for digits
before the decimal point.

@raise RangeError if digits is not in the range accepted by this function (what do you mean "vague"?)
