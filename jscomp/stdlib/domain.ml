(* Our implementation assumes that it may run in a "concurrent"
   setting, and that its "domain-global" data structures must be
   protected / used atomically. For simplicity, we just use a lock.

   Potential sources of "concurrent" usage of this library are as follows:
   - A multi-threaded OCaml 4 program uses the library.
     A race between two threads calling DLS.get and DLS.set at the same time
     might result in incorrect results (in absence of explicit synchronization)
     if one thread yields in the middle of an internal hashtable operation.
   - An OCaml 5 program uses the library. I'm not sure why that would happen,
     but it sounds silly enough that it will probably be done someday.

   Most use of locks below are innocuous performance-wise, as it only
   occurs on domain lifetime event (deletion and termination). The
   exceptions are its usage in DLS.get and DLS.set, which may be
   performance-sensitive. Ideally we would use a data-structure that allows
   for lock-free thread-local storage.
