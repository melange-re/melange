(* The path of [bsc] and [bsdep] is normalized so that the invokation of [./jscomp/bin/bsb.exe]
   and [bsb.exe] (combined with a dirty bsconfig.json) will not trigger unnecessary rebuild.

   The location of [bsc] and [bsdep] is configured by the combination of [Sys.executable_name]
   and [cwd].

   In theory, we should also check the integrity of [bsb.exe], if it is changed, the rebuild
   should be regen, but that is too much in practice, not only you need check the integrity of
   path of [bsb.exe] but also the timestamp, to make it 100% correct, also the integrity of
   [bsdep.exe] [bsc.exe] etc.
