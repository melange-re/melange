   Some rules:
   The name must be less than or equal to 214 characters. This includes the scope for scoped packages.
   The name can't start with a dot or an underscore.
   New packages must not have uppercase letters in the name.
   The name ends up being part of a URL, an argument on the command line, and a folder name. Therefore, the name can't contain any non-URL-safe characters.
