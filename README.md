# Melange

A _mixture_ of tooling combined to produce JS from OCaml / Reason.

This project is a fork of the
[ReScript compiler](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/) with
a focus on compatibility with the wider OCaml ecosystem. A small write-up with
more details on the motivation behind this project can be found in this
[blog post](https://anmonteiro.com/2021/03/on-ocaml-and-the-js-platform/).

## Installation

This project is currently unreleased. Currently, the easiest way to get started
is to clone the
[basic template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-basic-template). Before
you do, make sure you have Esy installed (`npm install -g esy` should cover
most workflows).

Please reach out on the [ReasonML Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) if you
can't figure it out!

#### A note on OCaml versions

The current Melange distribution works on OCaml 4.14 and OCaml 5.00+trunk. If
you need to use Melange with OCaml 4.12 (the only formerly supported version),
you can consume the [0.1.0 tag](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/releases/tag/0.1.0)
for this repo (make sure to similarly use the [`4.12.0+mel` tag](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-compiler-libs/releases/tag/4.12.0%2Bmel)
for [`melange-compiler-libs`](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-compiler-libs)).

### Can I use ReScript syntax?

Yes! ReScript syntax is supported, but beware that it's stuck on an ancient
OCaml version (4.06, released in 2018), and it won't have as many features as
the OCaml or Reason syntaxes
(e.g. [`letop` binding operators](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/1947),
[generalized module open expressions](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/2147),
or [local substitutions in signatures](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/2122)).

### Where has the `refmt` flag gone?

Upstream [removed the `refmt`](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/4998/commits/be9b1add647859d595dc2e2cbd5552ca246d1df9)
flag, which used to allow configuring the path to a custom Reason binary. This
was a welcome change for this repo too, so we cherry-picked it. The rationale:
this project uses [Reason](https://github.com/reasonml/reason) as a library,
so you can simply depend on the Reason version that you'd like in the usual way,
via your preferred package manager.
