Powered by the versatile OCaml type system, with best-in-class type inference,
Melange produces robust JavaScript code.

## Installation

Melange is released to OPAM. You can obtain it in multiple ways:

### [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/)

```shell
$ opam install mel
```

#### Template

[melange-re/melange-opam-template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-opam-template)
provides a GitHub
[template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
that can be used as a project starter.

**Note**: `mel build` builds a Melange project. Before running the resulting
JavaScript, the Melange runtime library needs to be present in `node_modules`
so that it can be found by JavaScript based tooling:

``` shell
ln -sfn $(opam var prefix)/lib/melange/runtime node_modules/melange
```

#### Manual setup

After installing Melange, you should now be able to run `mel` from your switch:

```shell
$ opam exec -- mel --help
```

### [Esy](https://esy.sh)

Get Esy on NPM:

- `npm install -g esy` installs Esy globally
- if `npm` is installed, `npx esy` can be used to run Esy locally

An [Esy project starter](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-basic-template)
also exists to get started quickly with Esy.

Once the repository has been cloned, run `esy` in the project root.

### [Nix](https://nixos.org/learn.html)

Melange has good support for Nix:

- `nix run github:melange-re/melange#mel -- --help` runs melange.
- `nix shell github:melange-re/melange#mel -c $SHELL` enters a shell with `mel`
  and `melc` in `$PATH`. Try out `mel --help` for available options.
- `github:melange-re/melange` can be added as a
  [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) input

### OCaml version compatibility

The current Melange distribution targets OCaml 4.14. There's an
[old version of Melange based on OCaml 4.12](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/releases/tag/0.1.0)
that requires
[version `4.12.0+mel`](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-compiler-libs/releases/tag/4.12.0%2Bmel)
of [`melange-compiler-libs`](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-compiler-libs).

## Editor integration

- Until Melange has first-class support in Dune, editor integration is based on
a [`.merlin` file workflow](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/project-configuration).
  - Melange generates `.merlin` files automatically as part of the build

- `ocaml-lsp` based Language Server Protocol support needs to be configured as
  follows:

### OPAM

Install `ocaml-lsp` and `dot-merlin-reader`:

```shell
$ opam install ocaml-lsp dot-merlin-reader
```

### Esy

Add the following to `esy.json`:

```jsonc
// esy.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@opam/ocaml-lsp-server": ">= 1.12.0",
    "@opam/dot-merlin-reader": "*"
  }
}
```

### Pass `--fallback-read-dot-merlin` to `ocaml-lsp`

`ocaml-lsp` requires the `--fallback-read-dot-merlin` flag to look for
`.merlin` files.

#### VSCode

- Install the [VSCode OCaml
  Platform](https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform) extension
- Select the "Custom" sandbox option and provide the flag to `ocaml-lsp` via
  the following command template:

```jsonc
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "ocaml.sandbox": {
    "kind": "custom",
    "template": "esy $prog $args --fallback-read-dot-merlin"
  }
}
```

## FAQ

### How does this project relate to other tools?

This project is forked from the
[ReScript compiler](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/),
focused on a deeper integration with the OCaml ecosystem. This allows sharing
code between backend and frontend using Dune's virtual libraries.

Melange also introduces a ReScript compatibility layer to maintain compatibility
with ReScript syntax - preserving access to ReScript's package ecosystem.

A small write-up with more details on the motivation behind this project can be
found in the announcement
[blog post](https://anmonteiro.com/2021/03/on-ocaml-and-the-js-platform/).

Below is a quick comparison between Melange and other tools:

### Can I use ReScript syntax?

Yes! ReScript syntax is supported, but ReScript won't have as many features as
the OCaml or Reason syntaxes due to ReScript being built on top of an old OCaml
version (4.06 - released in 2018).
(e.g. [`letop` binding operators](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/1947),
[generalized module open expressions](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/2147),
or [local substitutions in signatures](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/2122)).
