# Melange

### Tools for producing JS from Reason/OCaml.

Melange is a compiler for producing performant JavaScript from Reason and OCaml.
Powered by a strong static type system with best-in-class type inference based
on the OCaml compiler, Melange facilitates producing robust JavaScript code.

### Positioning in the broader OCaml ecosystem

This project is forked from the
[ReScript compiler](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/) shifting
focus to integrating with the OCaml ecosystem. This enables code sharing between
backend and frontend using Dune's virtual libraries.

Melange also introduces a ReScript compatibility layer to maintain compatibility
with ReScript's Syntax - preserving access to ReScripts ecosystem of packages.

Write in Reason/OCaml, use OCaml libraries or ReScript packages to kickstart
your project!

A small write-up with more details on the motivation behind this project can be
found in this
[blog post](https://anmonteiro.com/2021/03/on-ocaml-and-the-js-platform/).

## Installation

This project is currently unreleased. There are, however, a few ways to try it
out.

### [Esy](https://esy.sh)

The easiest way to get started is to
clone the [basic template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-basic-template)
and run `esy` in the project root. To install [Esy](https://esy.sh), `npm
install -g esy` should cover most workflows. If you have NodeJS / `npm`
available, `npx esy` is even shorter.

### [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/)

You can also install melange with `opam`:

- Pin melange to the version on GitHub:

    opam pin melange https://github.com/melange-re/melange.git

You should now be able to run melange from your switch:

    opam exec -- mel --help

Melange also has some runtime dependencies that need to be symlinked into `node_modules` to be discoverable by bundlers like webpack:

    rm -rf node_modules/melange
    mkdir -p node_modules/melange
    ln -sfn $(opam var prefix)/lib/melange node_modules/melange/lib

(adapted from the equivalent step in the esy build for `melange-basic-template`: https://github.com/melange-re/melange-basic-template/blob/3605fb491d45e74472be58f653482e15e21c9159/esy.json#L15).

### [Nix](https://nixos.org/learn.html)

Melange has good support for Nix:

- `nix run github:melange-re/melange -- build` runs melange.
- `nix shell github:melange-re/melange -c $SHELL` enters a shell with `mel` and
  `melc` in `$PATH`. Try out `mel --help`, for example.
  for available options.
- Adding `github:melange-re/melange` as a
  [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) input exports melange as the default
  package

Please reach out on the [ReasonML Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) if you
can't figure it out!

### Editor support

Until Melange has first-class support in Dune, `ocaml-lsp` support relies on
having Melange generate a `.merlin` file to provide the language server with
information about your project.

To enable editor support via `ocaml-lsp`, add the following to your `esy.json`:

```jsonc
// esy.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@opam/ocaml-lsp-server": ">= 1.12.0",
    "@opam/dot-merlin-reader": "*"
  }
}
```

Then use the `--fallback-read-dot-merlin` flag when running `ocaml-lsp`.

#### VSCode

If using the [VSCode OCaml
Platform](https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform) extension, use the
`Custom` sandbox option and provide the flag to `ocaml-lsp` via the command
template:

```jsonc
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "ocaml.sandbox": {
    "kind": "custom",
    "template": "esy $prog $args --fallback-read-dot-merlin"
  }
}
```

### A note on OCaml versions

The current Melange distribution works on OCaml 4.14 and OCaml 5.00+trunk. If
you need to use Melange with OCaml 4.12 (the only formerly supported version),
you can consume the [0.1.0 tag](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/releases/tag/0.1.0)
for this repo (make sure to similarly use the [`4.12.0+mel` tag](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-compiler-libs/releases/tag/4.12.0%2Bmel)
for [`melange-compiler-libs`](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-compiler-libs)).

### Can I use ReScript syntax?

Yes! ReScript syntax is supported, but ReScript won't have as many features as
the OCaml or Reason syntaxes due to ReScript being built on top of an old OCaml
version (4.06 - Released 2018).
(e.g. [`letop` binding operators](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/1947),
[generalized module open expressions](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/2147),
or [local substitutions in signatures](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/2122)).

### Where has the `refmt` flag gone?

Upstream [removed the `refmt`](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/4998/commits/be9b1add647859d595dc2e2cbd5552ca246d1df9)
flag, which used to allow configuring the path to a custom Reason binary. This
was a welcome change for this repo too, so we cherry-picked it. The rationale:
this project uses [Reason](https://github.com/reasonml/reason) as a library,
so you can simply depend on the Reason version that you'd like in the usual way,
via your preferred package manager.
