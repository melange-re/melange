Thanks for your interest! Below we describe Melange development setup for a few different package managers. If something isn't working, or you'd like to add another workflow, please let us know by filing an issue.

## Installation

Melange can be set up with [Nix](#Nix) or [opam](#opam). Instructions for each of them are detailed below.

### Nix

**Prerequisites**:
- Install the [Nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager
- Enable [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)

The best way to get started is to get a `nix` shell running:

```sh
# Runs a shell in the nix environment.
$ make nix-zsh
```

Once you're in the shell, you have access to `dune`, `node`, `yarn`, and all the other executables you need to get down to business.

- You can also use `make nix-*` to execute arbitrary commands in the nix environment. e.g. If you need a text editor running with the nix environment you can do

```sh
make nix-nvim # Runs nvim in the nix environment
make nix-code # Opens VSCode in the nix environment
make nix-fish # Runs fish shell in the nix environment
# etc.
```

### OPAM

**Prerequisites**:
- Install the [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) package manager
- Install `tree` command line tool (`brew install tree` for macOS or `apt install tree` for Linux)

After cloning the repository, make sure to initialize git submodules, so that
`melange-compiler-libs` is updated:

```sh
$ git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

To set up a development environment using [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/), run `make opam-init` to set up an opam [local switch](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-local-switches/) and download the required dependencies.

Install the dependencies in `melange.opam` without building and installing melange itself by running:

    $ opam install ./melange.opam --deps-only


If you plan to work on improving documentation, you will need to install `odoc`: `opam install odoc`.

## Developing

Before you try building the project with `dune`, be sure to install the local `ocaml-tree` project:

```sh
$ cd ocaml-tree
$ npm install
```

Here are some common commands you may find useful:

- `dune build` builds the whole project
- `dune runtest` runs the native tests
- `dune exec jscomp/main/melc.exe` is useful to run the development version of `melc`

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you are almost ready to open a PR, it's a good idea to run the full CI test suite locally to make sure everything works. First, open a new non-`nix` shell or exit your current `nix` shell by using the `exit` command or `CTRL+D`. Then, run the following command:

```sh
# Runs the full CI test suite
$ nix-build nix/ci/test.nix
```

If that all passes, then congratulations! You are well on your way to becoming a contributor ðŸŽ‰

To submit a Pull Request, follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) on creating one from a fork.

## Update JS Reserved Keywords Map

The compiler sources include a list of reserved JS keywords in
`jscomp/ext/js_reserved_map.ml` which includes all identifiers in global scope
(`window` / `globalThis`). This list should be updated from time to time for
newer browser versions.

To update it, run:

```sh
npm install puppeteer
node scripts/build_reserved.js
```
