Unreleased
---------------

- Build executables for bytecode-only platforms too
  ([#596](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/596))
- Move the entire builtin PPX to `melange.ppx`. Preprocessing with
  `melange.ppx` will needed in most cases going forward, as it's responsible
  for processing `external` declarations, `@deriving` attributes and more,
  compared to the previous release where `melange.ppx` just processed AST
  extension nodes ([#583](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/583))
- Remove old BuckleScript-style conditional compilation
  ([#605](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/605))
- Don't emit JS import / require paths with `foo/./bar.js`
  ([#598](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/issues/598),
  [#612](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/612))
- Wrap the melange runtime
  ([#624](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/624),
  [#637](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/637)). After this change,
  Melange exposes fewer toplevel modules. Melange runtime / stdlib modules are
  now wrapped under:
    - `Caml*` / `Curry` modules are part of the runtime and keep being exposed
      as before
    - `Js.*` contains all the modules previously accessible via `Js_*`, e.g.
      `Js_int` -> `Js.Int`
    - `Belt.*` wraps all the `Belt` modules; `Belt_List` etc. are not exposed
      anymore, but rather nested under `Belt`, e.g. `Belt.List`
    - `Node.*`: we now ship a `melange.node` library that includes the modules
      containing Node.js bindings. After this change, users will have to depend
      on `melange.node` explicitly in order to use the `Node.*` modules
    - `Dom.*`: we now ship a `melange.dom` library that includes the modules
      containing Node.js bindings. This library is included by default so the
      `Dom` module will always be available in Melange projects.
- Disable warning 61 (`unboxable-type-in-prim-decl`) for externals generated by
  Melange ([#641](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/641),
  [#643](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/643))

1.0.0 2023-05-31
---------------

- melange: print an error message if `$MELANGELIB` is set to a directory that
  doesn't exist ([#449](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/449))
- melange: fix bug where `--bs-module-name` didn't always affect generated JS
  file casing ([#446](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/446))
- melange: fix bug where `-o output.js` didn't always write a JavaScript file
  ([#454](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/454))
- melange: remove the `-bs-read-cmi` flag in favor of the builtin
  `-intf-suffix` flag, standard in OCaml
  ([#458](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/458),
  [#460](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/460))
- melange: return an actionable error message when no output is specified
  with `-impl` / `-intf`
  ([#465](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/465),
  [#466](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/466))
- melange: use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` in the `Caml_obj` runtime
  ([#469](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/469))
- melange: transform
  [`NonEscapeCharacter`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-NonEscapeCharacter)
  correctly in JS strings (those written using `{js|string here|js}`)
  ([#469](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/469))
- melange: define `MELANGE` conditional compilation variable
  ([#472](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/472))
- melange: Make `Pervasives` exactly match the `Stdlib` behavior
  ([#476](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/476))
- melange: fix unbound error when trying to use `Printexc.exn_slot_id`
  ([#482](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/482))
- melange: fix codegen issue accessing a nested module path that is also
  `include`d ([#487](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/487))
- melange: preserve the correct command-line order for load path directories
  ([#492](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/492))
- melange: respect the `-nostdlib` option; don't add stdlib / runtime to the
  load path in that case
  ([#496](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/496))
- melange: build the Melange runtime / stdlib / runtime tests with the dune
  integration ([#493](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/493)). Thus
  melange now requires Dune 3.8.
- melange: allow shadowing sub-modules of Stdlib in user projects
  ([#512](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/512))
- melange, reactjs-jsx-ppx: introduce a `reactjs-jsx-ppx` package, remove its
  dependency from melange
  ([#517](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/517))
- melange: remove the `--bs-jsx <version>` flag from `melc` now that
  `reactjs-jsx-ppx` is a separate package
  ([#525](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/525))
- melange: add `melpp` executable to preprocess `#if` conditionals with the
  melange parser ([#539](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/539))
- mel: delete the `mel` package. The dune integration is now the only
  officially supported workflow for orchestrating melange builds
  ([#546](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/546))
- melange: Extract `melange.ppx` from the melange package. This preprocessing
  step interprets extensions such as `%bs.obj`, `%bs.raw` and `%bs.re`,
  `[@@deriving {abstract,accessors,jsConverters}]` and `external` declarations.
  ([#534](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/534))
- melange: allow installing melange in more OCaml versions and compiler
  switches. Melange now migrates binary AST to the version it understands
  ([#548](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/548))
- melange: don't run anonymous args function from
  `[@@@bs.config {flags = [| ... |]}]` attributes
  ([#554](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/554))
- melange: add `--preamble` flag to add a preamble to emitted JS. An example is
  `"use client";` in React Server Components, which needs to appear before
  imports ([#545](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/545),
  [#574](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/574))
- melange: turn off warning 20 (`ignore-extra-argument`) by default. This
  warning is rarely useful in Melange due to false positives when invoking
  functions defined with `%bs.raw`
  ([#488](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/488),
  [#576](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/576))

0.3.2 2022-11-19
---------------

- `ppx_rescript_compat` (ReScript compatibility layer): fix conversion for
  cases such as `foo["bar"] = assignment`
  ([#441](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/441)):
  - These are now correctly converted to the OCaml equivalent:
    `foo##bar #= assignment`
- mel: fix merlin generation, broken since `mel` was moved to its own package
  ([#442](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/442))

0.3.1 2022-11-16
---------------

- Disable warning 69 (`unused-field` in record) for the private record
  generated by the `bs.deriving` attribute
  ([#414](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/414))
- Disable warning 20 (`ignored-extra-argument`) when applying
  `foo##fn arg1 arg2`
  ([#416](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/416)):
  - in cases such as `external x : < .. > Js.t = ""`, the typechecker doesn't
    know the arity of the function, even though Melange will emit an uncurried
    function call.
- Disable warning 61 (`unboxable-type-in-prim-decl`) in `external` declarations
  ([#415](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/415)):
  - Melange externals are substantially different from OCaml externals. This
    warning doesn't make sense in a JS runtime.
- melc: introduce `--bs-module-name` flag to specify the original file name for
  the current compilation unit
  ([#413](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/413))
  - Dune's namespacing implementation generates modules such as
    `lib__Original_name`. Passing `--bs-module-name original_name` allows
    melange to issue correct `import` / `require` statements to the unmangled
    JS file names.

0.3.0 2022-11-06
---------------

- melange Introduce 2 explicit modes of JavaScript compilation:
  - "Batch compilation": produces `.cmj` and `.js` files at the same time (this
    is the previous behavior -- using `--bs-package-output
    MODULE_SYSTEM:REL_PATH:JS_EXTENSION`)
  - "Separate emission": produces _only_ `.cmj` files with `--bs-stop-after-cmj
    --bs-package-output REL_PATH_ONLY`, and allows emitting JavaScript files
    separately, with `--bs-module-type MODULE_SYSTEM -o
    TARGET_FILE.JS_EXTENSION`
  ([#384](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/384))
- mel: Fix `mel build --watch` exiting after the first change
  ([#401](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/401))
- melange: Remove dependency on `reason`. Reason syntax users should install`
  reason` from their preferred package manager instead, and Melange / Dune will
  find it in `$PATH` ([#409](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/409))
- melange: Remove dependency on `napkin` (the ReScript syntax parser). Users
  that depend on libraries written in ReScript syntax should install the `mel`
  package and Melange / Dune will find the `rescript_syntax` binary in `$PATH`
  ([#411](https://github.com/melange-re/melange/pull/411))

0.2.0 2022-10-24
--------------

- Initial release supporting OCaml 4.14.

0.1.0 2022-03-08
--------------

- Initial public release

This is the only release of Melange that supports OCaml 4.12.
